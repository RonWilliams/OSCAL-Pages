If you work closely with us, you might have noticed we finished a large code repository reorganization alongside the release of OSCAL v1.1.0 and the subsequent [OSCAL v1.1.1 release] (https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases/tag/v1.1.1). The OSCAL Project was in a desperate need of some internal restructuring, a fall cleaning of sorts. As an OSCAL user, the differences should not affect affect you, but we will still summarize some key changes for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
